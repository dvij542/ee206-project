  By not providing "Findmy_sync_package.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "my_sync_package", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "my_sync_package"
  with any of the following names:

    my_sync_packageConfig.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "my_sync_package" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "my_sync_package_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "my_sync_package" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
