## SSH into 337 cory lab machine

```ssh dvij@10.41.45.23```

passwd: dvij123

## Installation on local machine

1. Clone the repo

    ``` git clone https://github.com/dvij542/ee206-project```

2. Install dependencies

    ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```

    OR 
    
    With conda:-
    
    ```conda env create --name ee206 --file=environment.yml``` 

3. Install ROS Noetic for ubuntu 20.04/ compatible ROS1 version based on your system: [Link](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu)

## Running

1. (optional) To run training on any environment, specify the environment in train.py and run:-

    ```python3 train.py```
    
    NOTE: This is not required as the trained models for each environemnt is already present under logs/

2. To launch any environment and check it's performance, run:-

    ```python3 eval.py [--gantry] [--table] [--render] [--ik_rl]```
  
    **a.** Enabling 'gantry' option will enable XY movement of the base. Note that we do not have a gantry for the robot yet (It has been ordered and may arrive in a month but should be fine without that)
    
    **b.** Enabling 'table' option will add the ping pong table to the environment with random generated ball throws towards the robot. It will also generate a target pose for the robot if able to be achieved in time, it will be able to return the ball to the center of the other side of the table. It woukd be in most cases
    
    **c.** Enabling 'render' option will render the environment
    
    **d.** Enabling 'ik_rl' option will use a more stable controller based on RL based IK solving to generate target robot pose. This is available for only without gantry for now
    
    To launch environment with gantry and table, run:-
    
    ``` python3 eval.py --gantry --table --render```
    
    To launch environment without gantry and with table, run:-
    
    ``` python3 eval.py --table --render```
    
    To launch environment without gantry and with table and with a more stable RL based IK solver, run:-
    
    ``` python3 eval.py --table --ik_rl --render```

3. To launch gazebo environment provided by Kuka iiwa and control the robot with our solvers, open 2 new terminals and follow these steps:-

    **a.** On terminal 1, source ROS1 noetic OR the distro installed on your system and then launch gazebo sim
    
    ``` 
    source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    source lbr_fri_ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch lbr_moveit moveit_planning_execution.launch model:=iiwa14 sim:=true 
    ```
    
    **b.** On terminal 2, source ROS1 noetic OR the distro installed on your system and then run eval_ros.py
    
    ``` 
    source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
    source lbr_fri_ros_ws/devel/setup.bash
    python3 eval_ros.py [--ik_rl] [--ik] 
    ```
    
    No options enabled will run the basic trained RL environment which may not run very well due to sim-to-real transfer. 'ik_rl' option will enable using RL based IK solver which will be more stable. 'ik' will enable traditional IK based solver

## TODO:-

1. (Setup ROS1 based twin simulator in mujoco)

    **a.** Subscribe to '\ball_pose' topic containing ball position and velocity. Write a separate node to predict the ball trajectory and target pose for the robot (Refer to moujoco_env_kuka_with_table.py.
    
    **b.** Control the robot through '/lbr/PositionJointInterface_trajectory_controller/command' topic. Write a separate node which subscribes to '/lbr/PositionJointInterface_trajectory_controller/command' topic and passes the commands to mujoco sim and it also publishes the joint angle and joint velocities as robot state to '/lbr/PositionJointInterface_trajectory_controller/state'. It should also publish to '/ball_pose' to get the ground truth ball pose. This piece will be replaced by the node that Emily and Max are working on. 
    
    **c.** Something like eval_ros.py can be used to communicate with (b) to control the robot through '/lbr/PositionJointInterface_trajectory_controller/command' topic
