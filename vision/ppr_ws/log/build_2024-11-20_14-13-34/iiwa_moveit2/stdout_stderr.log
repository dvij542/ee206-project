[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_common.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_common", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "moveit_common"
  with any of the following names:

    moveit_commonConfig.cmake
    moveit_common-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_common" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "moveit_common_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "moveit_common" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
